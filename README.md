# Smart-Healthcare-AI-Infused-Saline-Monitoring-System-With-IoT
 * This project aims an IoT- based saline tracker which efficiently monitors and manages saline levels, enhancing patient care and medical resources utilization . It offers real-time monitoring of saline levels.

*Problem Statement :- In modern healthcare settings, the accurate and real-time monitoring of intravenous (IV) saline infusion is a critical aspect of patient care. The manual monitoring of IV saline flow is prone to human error, leading to potential complications such as overhydration or underhydration, which can have serious implications for patient safety and treatment outcomes. Current monitoring systems lack the sophistication required to provide a seamless and proactive solution for healthcare providers. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of an AI-infused Saline Monitoring System with IoT integration that ensures precise and continuous monitoring of IV saline flow, early detection of anomalies, and timely intervention to enhance patient care, reduce healthcare costs, and improve overall healthcare quality. This project aims to address this challenge and revolutionize the way saline infusion is managed in healthcare facilities
